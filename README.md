# Logrank-Inaccuracies
This repository contains code to reproduce the results presented in "Inaccuracy of the logrank approximation in cancer data analysis".

The implementation of the permutation-based method to compute the exact log-rank p-value is based on code from the permGS R package:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/permGS/index.html

The data needed to reproduce the TCGA analyses are here: http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/multi_omic_benchmark/download.html.

The data needed to reproduce the clusternomics and murine model of endotoxemia are available in this repository.
