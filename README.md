This repository contains code to reproduce the results presented in "Inaccuracy of the logrank approximation in cancer data analysis".
It requires the code from the repository: https://github.com/Shamir-Lab/Multi-Omics-Cancer-Benchmark.
The data needed to reproduce the TCGA analyses are here: http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/multi_omic_benchmark/download.html.
The data needed to reproduce the clusternomics and murine model of endotoxemia are available in this repository.
